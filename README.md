### Running the application
- Once the above dependecides are installed, run the following command to run the application: 
    ``` 
    npm start
This will start the server and you should see the message <code>App is running</code> in your terminal indicating the server is running.
- The application can be accessed at http://localhost:5500 through your browser. 
### API Information
- We are using the Adopt-a-Pet.com Basic API, and one GET endpoint we are using is /search/pet_search. This endpoint returns a list of pets that match the search. The other GET endpoint we are using from Adopt-a-Pet.com Basic API is /search/limited_pet_details. This endpoint provides a full list of details about the pet as well as a link to the animal's page on [adoptapet.com](https://www.adoptapet.com/) which can provide the user with more details about the animal.
- We also connected to an external database in supabase with a POST endpoint. This database is called "Customer", and it stores the information filled out by the user in the contact form on the <code>Help and Contact</code> page. 
### Comments 
- Not all animals have a photo associated with them. 
- jQuery was used for some front end styling. 
- Future development could include expanding the types of animals up for adoption (fish, bunnies, birds, etc.). Also, adding an interactive map to visually show where the animals are up for adoption could be something to add in the future.
